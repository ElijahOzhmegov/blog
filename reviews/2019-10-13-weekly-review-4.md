## Python

My tries to regain all my knowledge in Python as well as in useful tools for Data Science course.

- **[Нескучный туториал по NumPy](https://habr.com/ru/post/469355/)**
- **[Python File Importation into Multi-Level Directory Modules and Packages](https://sweetcode.io/python-file-importation-multi-level-directory-modules-packages/)**

## Haskell

There is an article more about stack than Hakyll library.

- **[How to Build with Stack](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/stack-build)**

## R, RStudio

Unfortunately, without practical appliance it's hard to remember everything at once. So without any doubt I will come back to some articles in the list below.

- **[Binomial Distribution](http://www.r-tutor.com/elementary-statistics/probability-distributions/binomial-distribution)**
- **[This R Data Import Tutorial Is Everything You Need](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-data-import-tutorial#gs.oeoGUXk)**
- **[Using latex2exp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/latex2exp/vignettes/using-latex2exp.html)**

## Pygame

I need to create certain software complex project, so there is some useful articles to build a front-end part. I guess in the future I give more information.

- **[The python Game Book](http://thepythongamebook.com/en:pygame:step002)**
- **[Python | format() function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-format-function/)**
- **[Pygame | Built-in Objects](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/builtins.html)**
