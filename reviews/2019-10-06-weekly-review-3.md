I have been extremely busy during the last 20 weeks. Business trips, getting place at the German University, getting Visa and lots of different things, so I have not published prepared articles about my favourite text editor VIM, and I have skipped reviews on interesting articles.

## Python

The most interesting thing here for me is pytest, I have been using GoogleTest Framework for some time, so now it is hard for me do not test every piece of code.

- **[Python Matrices and NumPy Arrays](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/matrix)**
- **[How to Generate a Random Number in Python](https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-generate-a-random-number-in-python/)**
- **[Pytest: Installation and Getting Started](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html)**
- **[Pytest: Basic patterns and examples](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.html)**

## Proxy

During visiting my close friend, I have found out that between his computer and the Internet placed a proxy server, so I have just tried to understand reasons for that.

## R, RStudio

At my first classes on Computational Statistics I have googled little bit instead of asking questions, here you can see the most useful links.

- **[Is there a technical difference between “=” and “<-” [duplicate]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6140694/is-there-a-technical-difference-between-and)**
