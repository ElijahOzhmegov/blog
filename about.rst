Hello friend.

My name is Ilia Ozhmegov and I am a young programmer, passionate about Computer Science and Mathematics: from the history of creation the first computer to the methods of optimisation in deep learning.

I studied at the Faculty of Mechatronics and Robotics of St.Petersburg Polytechnic University. Apart from that, I work for a Scientific Center that is developing software for embedded devices as well as devices itself.

It would be great if you find my blog interesting.

And one more thing. English is not my first language, but I promise doing all my bests. Nevertheless, I will make mistakes. So when you find one, I would be grateful to know.
