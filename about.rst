Hello, friend.

My name is Ilia Ozhmegov and I am a young programmer, passionate about Computer Science and Mathematics: from the history of creating the first computer to the methods of optimization in deep learning.

I have studied at the Faculty of Mechatronics and Robotics of St.Petersburg Polytechnic University. Now, I am getting Master Degree in Data Science at Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin. Apart from that, I am working for a Scientific Center that is developing software for embedded devices as well as creating devices itself.

It would be great if you find my blog interesting.

And one more thing. English is not my first language, but I promise to do all my best to avoid mistakes. Nevertheless, I will make them, so when you find the one, I would be grateful to know.
